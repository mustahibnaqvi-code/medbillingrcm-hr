### 2. Initialize Git and Commit Changes

Run these commands in your project directory (`my-mbrcm-portal`):

```bash
# Initialize a new Git repository
git init

# --- Set Author Identity (Necessary for Git Commit) ---
git config --global user.email "mustahibnaqvi@gmail.com"
git config --global user.name "mustahibnaqvi-code"

# Add the new netlify.toml file and all configurations
git add .

# Commit your files
git commit -m "Netlify config fix (netlify.toml) and final deployment cleanup"
```

### 3. Push to GitHub to Trigger Netlify Build

Run the push command to send the clean configuration to GitHub:

```bash
# Push the code to the main branch
# (Use your PAT for authentication)
git push -u origin main
```

## Phase 3: Deployment

Netlify will automatically detect this push and attempt a new build. After the build completes (usually 1-2 minutes), check your Netlify dashboard to confirm the deploy was successful, and then clear your browser cache before visiting the site again.
